# MD5_RFC1321
This repository is a implementation of __MD5__ in C. 
Although it has been added as appendix in RFC1321.
But that program was written in old C. There are too much change in syntax.
So I rebuilt it in Xcode.But now ,it can only digest from file.
I hope someone can help me to accomplish it.
You can download it to check where I fixed.
